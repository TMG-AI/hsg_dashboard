# n8n Workflow Fix - Stop Multiple Emails

## Problem
The "Merge Articles" node creates a feedback loop back to "SplitInBatches", causing articles to be processed multiple times and sending 15+ emails.

## Solution
Replace the workflow connections as follows:

### Current (BROKEN) Flow:
```
Log Webhook → Merge Articles → SplitInBatches (LOOP!) + Prepare Email Digest
```

### Fixed Flow:
```
Log Webhook → Aggregate All Articles → Prepare Email Digest
```

## Step-by-Step Fix in n8n:

### 1. Delete the "Merge Articles" node
- Click on "Merge Articles" node
- Press Delete key

### 2. Add a new Function node called "Aggregate All Articles"
- Position it between "Log Webhook" and "Prepare Email Digest"
- Use this code:

```javascript
// Wait for all articles to complete the loop, then aggregate once
const allArticles = $input.all();

console.log(`Aggregating ${allArticles.length} processed articles`);

// Pass all articles as a single output for email digest
return allArticles;
```

### 3. Update Connections:

**Connect:**
- `Log Webhook` → `Aggregate All Articles`
- `Aggregate All Articles` → `Prepare Email Digest`
- `Prepare Email Digest` → `Send Email Digest`

**Remove the connection from:**
- `Merge Articles` → `SplitInBatches` (this is the infinite loop!)

### 4. Update "SplitInBatches" Settings:

In the SplitInBatches node, make sure:
- **When Done** is set to: "Wait for completion"
- **Reset** is set to: `false` (unchecked)

This ensures it processes all emails once, then stops.

## Alternative: Use n8n's Built-in Aggregate Node

Instead of the Function node, you can use n8n's built-in **Aggregate** node:

1. Add an **Aggregate** node between "Log Webhook" and "Prepare Email Digest"
2. Settings:
   - **Aggregate**: "All Input Items"
   - **Execution mode**: "Each Item" → "Once"

## Test Your Fix

After making these changes:
1. Save the workflow
2. Click "Execute Workflow"
3. Check that you receive **ONE email** with all articles
4. Verify the email contains all China-related articles grouped by newsletter

## What Was Wrong

The original workflow had this flow:
```
Extract Articles (15 articles)
  ↓
SplitInBatches (process one at a time)
  ↓
China Check → Collect_China_Articles → Summarize → Send to Dashboard → Log Webhook
  ↓
Merge Articles
  ↓↓
  ├→ BACK TO SplitInBatches (infinite loop!) ❌
  └→ Prepare Email Digest
```

This created a feedback loop where each article would re-trigger SplitInBatches, causing exponential processing.

## The Fixed Flow

```
Get Emails
  ↓
SplitInBatches
  ↓
Get Message Details → Parse Newsletter → Extract Articles
  ↓
China Check → Collect_China_Articles
  ↓
Summarize Article → Format Summary → Send to Dashboard → Log Webhook
  ↓
[SplitInBatches loops back here until all emails done]
  ↓
Aggregate All Articles (NEW - replaces Merge)
  ↓
Prepare Email Digest
  ↓
Send Email Digest (ONE email with all articles)
```

The key is that **SplitInBatches handles its own looping internally** - you don't need to manually connect back to it!
